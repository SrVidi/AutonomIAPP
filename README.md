## Environment Setup

This project uses environment variables for configuration. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Create a new file in your local project directory named `.env`

2. Copy the contents of `.env.example` into your new `.env` file

3. Replace the placeholder values in your `.env` file with your actual configuration:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_google_api_key
   ```

4. Do not commit your `.env` file to the repository. It's listed in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

Note: The `.env` file should only exist on your local machine, not in this GitHub repository.
