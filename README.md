## Environment Setup

This project uses environment variables for configuration. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Create a file named `.env`:

2. Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_google_api_key
   ```

3. Do not commit your `.env` file to the repository. It's listed in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.
